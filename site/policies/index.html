            <h1>Isaac&rsquo;s Site Policies</h1>
                <p>I&rsquo;m committed to providing a great experience on my websites. This page documents standards and policies that I apply to myself and my sites. Note that while I try very hard to implement these, I do not have a legal obligation to do so, and this page does not create any such obligation.</p>
                <p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the legal terms, try finding the document on <a href="https://www.isaac.run/terms/">www.isaac.run/terms</a>.</p>

            <h2>Link permanence</h2>
                <p>Every link I have ever made should continue to work. Over the years I have visited many websites from a broken referral link, and I believe very strongly in digital preservation. Any link you see today for isaac.run, xtzws.com, or 10161997.xyz should continue to work ten years from now. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that my sites will never be reorganized, but rather that redirects will be used to guide you to a webpage&rsquo;s new home. For example, when www.isaac.run was just starting, the terms of use were at www.isaac.run/ifdsa, but I implemented and published additional terms, so that link is still valid but will take you to www.isaac.run/terms/ifdsa. Note that this link permanence policy does not apply to my CDNs or files that have been removed (<a href="https://cdn.isaac.run/running/DCN-SAN-RO-20250709-latest.pdf">example</a>).</p>

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
                <p>I strive to make my websites pleasant to look at and easy to read. Specifically, I aim for WCAG AA 2.0 complicance. If anything is wrong, could be improved, or you have any questions, my email is open anytime at <a href="mailto:webmaster@isaac.run">webmaster@isaac.run</a>.</p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>All of my domains should have a lock in the browser or the Web address should begin with HTTPS. I also aim for high scores on the MDN HTTP Observatory, but I can't always commit to a specific score.
