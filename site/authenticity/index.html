<h1>Authentic Isaacal Media websites</h1>
<p>Isaacal Media operates several websites and services under different domain names. This page documents standard practices that you can expect from official sites.</p>
<main>
<p>Here are the essentials about Isaacal Media services and domains:</p>
<ul><li>All domains use HTTPS. This means the Web address starts with https:// or has a lock ( ðŸ”’ ) in your Web browser</li>
<li>Regardless of how many official domains there are, all emails will be sent from an email address ending in @isaac.run</li>
<li>There are five official domains used by Isaacal Media. They are:
<ol><li>.isaac.run</li>
<li>.xtzws.com</li>
<li>.10161997.xyz</li>
<li>.09011994.xyz</li>
<li>.04062001.xyz</li>
</ol></li></ul>
<p>Isaacal Media holds five domains. All official services will end in one of these domains, so verify that you are on the correct website before submitting sensitive information such as personal details or health information.</p>
<p>All Isaacal Media websites use HTTPS (https:// or the lock). If the website looks right but does not have the lock, your network may have been compromised or there may be an issue with the website. In any case, immediately close the tab and email <a href="mailto:webmaster@isaac.run">webmaster@isaac.run</a> if you need support.</p>
<p>.isaac.run is the primary website for Isaacal Media. Most customer-facing services are operated from here, such as bank.isaac.run or forms.isaac.run.</p>
<p>.xtzws.com is where most backend technical services are operated from. You will likely never need to go here, but you may see it referenced sometimes, especially if you snoop around enough.</p>
<p>.10161997.xyz, .09011994.xyz, and .04062001.xyz are all for reference purposes. Before new features are launched, they will be tested using one of these domains. If you come across one, congrats! These should be considered unstable and potentially insecure, so use them with caution.</p>
<p>All websites ending in .isaac.run will also include the banner notifying you that you are on an official Isaacal Media website (coming soon).</p>
<p>If you have any concerns about the legitimacy of a website, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@isaac.run">privacy@isaac.run</a>.</p>
