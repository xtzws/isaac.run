<h1>Authentic Isaacal Media websites</h1>
<p>Isaacal Media operates several websites and services under different domain names. This page documents standard practices that you can expect from official sites.</p>
<main>
<p>Here are the essentials about Isaacal Media services and domains:</p>
<ul><li>All domains use HTTPS. This means the Web address starts with https:// or has a lock ( 🔒 ) in your Web browser</li>
<li>All domains make use of DNSSEC, HSTS, and strict Content-Security-Policy configurations to keep you protected even in the event of some security breaches</li>
<li>All emails are verified with DKIM, SPF, and DMARC policies, with the mail server having PTR records for both IPv4 and IPv6, in addition to a DANE TLSA record</li>
<li>There are five official domains used by Isaacal Media. They are:
<ol><li>.isaac.run</li>
    <li>.zv.ax</li>
    <li>.xtzws.com</li>
    <li>.10161997.xyz</li>
    <li>.09011994.xyz</li>
</ol></li></ul>
<p>All official services will end in one of these domains, so verify that you are on the correct website before submitting sensitive information such as personal details or health records.</p>
<p>.isaac.run is the primary website for Isaacal Media. Most customer-facing services are operated from here, such as git.isaac.run or forms.isaac.run.</p>
<p>.zv.ax is a short-code domain. Some tools and link shorteners are located here, such as zv.ax/ai and IP address checker 4.zv.ax and 6.zv.ax.</p>
<p>.xtzws.com is where most backend technical services are operated from. You will likely never need to go here, but you may see it referenced sometimes, especially if you snoop around enough. There is a Gemini capsule at <a href="gemini://xtzws.com">gemini://xtzws.com</a> if you have a Gemini browser! <small>try <a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange</a></small></p>
<p>.10161997.xyz and .09011994.xyz are for reference purposes. Before new features are launched, they will be tested using one of these domains. If you come across one, congrats! These should be considered unstable and potentially insecure, so use them with caution.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns about the legitimacy of a website, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@isaac.run">privacy@isaac.run</a>.</p>
