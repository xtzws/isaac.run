    <h2>Physical website</h2>
    <p>Standard copyright</p>
    <p>Despise using the computer? Wish you could go back to the good ol&rsquo; days of reading real paper? Now you can! Request a monthly subscription to isaac.run and be mailed physical copies of changes, specially formatted and marked to make offline viewing easier. For a one-time fee, you can also pay to get a copy of every page in the archives.</p>

    <h2>Tech support</h2>
    <p>Free*, Personal, Commercial</p>
    <p>Having issues with your email, your phone is acting up, or suddenly the mouse doesn&rsquo;t work? Isaac to the rescue! I can help with minor issues like these, or downloading and installing some apps. For more advanced setup and support, consider hiring me as a sysadmin.<br>* With limits</p>

    <h2>Email</h2>
    <p>Personal, Commercial</p>
    <p>If you are looking to take the next step in your branding, a custom email is the way to go. Not only does yourname@example.com look cooler, it&rsquo;s also more memorable and trustworthy. <br>* Custom domain required in most cases, which you may already have if you subscribe to another service.</p>

    <h2>Marketing email</h2>
    <p>Commercial</p>
    <p>If you need to send mass email, like with a newsletter or event management, this service is for you. Please note that you will not receive mail from the sender address, so this can&rsquo;t be used as a primary contact. <br>* Custom domain required, which you may already have if you subscribe to another service.</p>

    <h2>Marketing SMS</h2>
    <p>Commercial</p>
    <p>SMS messages have a 98% open rate. If you&rsquo;re looking to expand your business with text updates, this service is for you.</p>
    <p>I believe in simple pricing you can understand. SMS marketing costs $15/month plus $0.015 per message.</p>

    <h2>Web design</h2>
    <p>Personal, Commercial</p>
    <p>Looking for a website? Ecommerce, blog, portfolio, student group? I can make these! Fill out the form at <a href="https://forms.isaac.run">forms.isaac.run</a> with code &laquo;WEB&raquo;.</p>

    <h2>Web hosting</h2>
    <p>Free, Personal, Commercial</p>
    <p>Just need to put a file online? Do it with me! Bring-your-own-domain or get an xtzws.com subdomain. Web UI, FTP/SFTP, and WebDAV access options. Also available is file hosting that is not publicly accessible.</p>

    <h2>Cloud storage</h2>
    <p>Commercial</p>
    <p>While web hosting is plenty in most cases, you might require more than what&rsquo;s offered with standard hosting. Cloud block storage can be purchased in blocks of 100GB with more flexible options available on request.</p>

    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>Personal, Commercial</p>
    <p>If you have a website, it&rsquo;s helpful to know who&rsquo;s visiting. Offered as a bonus with web hosting, web analytics give you just the right amount of detail into the popularity of your website. Email analytics are included with mass marketing.</p>

    <h2>Sysadmin</h2>
    <p>Commercial</p>
    <p>Need a custom server managed? I can procure and maintain applications and servers on your behalf, including enterprise software. This includes web and email servers, Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace, or bring-your-own and I provide hosting! This is separate from hosting: with me as a sysadmin, you would already have a server under your control, but I would install and maintain software. If you subscribe to a SaaS offering, I would step in as "the IT guy" and handle integrations with your other software.</p>

    <h3>Game server</h3>
    <p>Personal</p>
    <p>Want to play private games with your friends? I can manage private, invite-only servers for several games, including Minecraft, Counter Strike, ARK, and Rust.</p>

    <h2>Vectorization</h2>
    <p>Free, Personal, Commercial</p>
    <p>Do those pesky jpegs come up and you realize, &ldquo;hey, I need this really big&rdquo; but then it looks bad? Get it vectorized! I can vectorize images, PDFs, and other static visual media. Offered on an &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis.</p>

    <h2>Domain management</h2>
    <p>Commercial</p>
    <p>Often included in my web hosting plans, custom domains allow you to have that extra control over your brand. You can use it for your website, your emails, and analytics. If you have a portfolio of domains, or are looking to create one, I can manage them for you and give you an extra layer of privacy.</p>

    <h2>Virtual Private Network</h2>
    <p>Free, Personal, Commercial</p>
    <p>Out using public WiFi and don&rsquo;t trust their network? Sounds like you&rsquo;re looking for a VPN. Virtual private networks hide network activity and helps prevent websites from determining your location. No account needed, just an access key. Current server location is Lansing, Michigan.</p>
