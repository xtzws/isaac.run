      <h2>Prepreamble</h2>
      <p>As you may have noticed, I&rsquo;m a fan of writing overly verbose legal documents. Read the <a href="/terms/icsa/">ICSA</a> as an example, or just check out how <a href="/terms/">many of them</a> I&rsquo;ve written. This one is also significantly longer than it needs to be, simply because that&rsquo;s how I want it.</p>

      <h2>Preamble</h2>
      <p>For all the copyright nerds out there, this is technically a &laquo;DEDICATION&raquo; or a &laquo;WAIVER&raquo; but I think &laquo;LICENSE&raquo; sounds and looks better, especially in the URL, and license is a little bit clearer at first glance for what this talking about.</p>
      <p>I was inspired by Kate Morley after blatantly stealing her <a href="https://iamkate.com/code/checkboxes-and-radio-buttons/">CSS for styling forms</a> which she makes available under the CC0. I did some introspection and realized that I expected all software to be free as in freedom and free as in beer, and it would be unfair if I didn&rsquo;t make my work available also. Hence why I&rsquo;m rambling to you now.</p>
      <p>You may be wondering, if you know of such things, why I don&rsquo;t just mark it with Creative Commons Zero and be done with it. The reason is that I wanted my work to actually be in the public domain, at least in my country, and not <em>very nearly</em> public domain. For many years, I&rsquo;ve made my work available to the no one who wants to use it. My first license was a restricted source available, future apps were under a more permissive license like the GNU GPL, WTFPL, and the SQLite Blessing. Creative works have long been licensed with various Creative Commons licenses, like CC BY-NC-ND for some English work, up to CC-BY for my iNaturalist contributions. I am entering my next phase of: who tf cares. My thinking for reserving some rights is that I might be able to make some money off of it in the future. But that is not going to happen. So I might as well make it available to the most people. Now onto the dedication.<p>

      <h2>Amble</h2>
      <p>To any artistic or literary work or document or software or other piece of writing (collectively, &ldquo;work&rdquo;) to which this license or a representation or a reference or a notice of this license has been applied, then this work is dedicated to the public domain in the United States.</p>
      <p>If you are in one of the other countries and:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you are in an area that recognizes a foreigner&rsquo;s right to dedicate their work to the public domain in the manner in which I have just done so for United States readers:
          <ul>
            <li>then this work is dedicated to the public domain</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>or you are in an area that does not recognize the public domain or does not allow a foreigner to place their work in the public domain in the manner in which I have done so above for United States readers or does not recognize a work that has been placed into the public domain by a foreigner in their home country if that work would otherwise be protected by your home country&rsquo;s copyright laws:
          <ul>
            <li>then this work is marked Creative Commons Zero</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If, in the rare circumstance that none of the above conditions apply to you, then you have no permission to use my work in any capacity and I will sue you for every penny you&rsquo;re worth.</p>

        <h2>Postamble</h2>
        <p>This could have been made much shorter by simply writing &laquo;This work is dedicated to the public domain the United States and marked CC0 elsewhere.&raquo; but they say brevity is the soul of wit, and this document is not supposed to be funny. Good day.</p>
