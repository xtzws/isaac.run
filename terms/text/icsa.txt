Isaac's Commercial Services Agreement

==============================================================================
1. Application
This document is an agreement between:
  Isaac Greene and my affiliates ("I", "me", "my", etc.); and 
  [business], and its members, officers, and agents.
"You" (or "your", "yours", etc.) refers both to the entity agreeing to this document 
and the above mentioned organization.

The Isaac's Commercial Services Agreement (the "Agreement") applies to your use 
of any commercial services (the or my "Services") provided to you by me. You 
acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services is governed by the terms of 
this Agreement. You warrant that you are a) acting as an individual or as an 
authorized agent on behalf of an organization; b) entering into this Agreement 
of your own free will; and c) truthfully representing your intended usage of my 
Services. This Agreement may change at any time with 30 days notice.

If you do not agree to this Agreement, you may not use the Services. If you 
reject this Agreement after previously agreeing to it, you must immediately 
cease use of the Services.

Service-specific terms are attached at the end of this Agreement. Where necessary, 
this Agreement may be modified to match your needs. Should this occur, an Addendum 
will be created and sent to you for the specific Services you use.

For each Service you use, a new account is created in your name for use in that 
particular Service. Your accounts are referred to collectively as the "Source 
Account", and any specific accounts are generically referred to as a "Service 
Account" for the Service you are using, or in reference to the Service provided. 
For example, "Website Account" and "VPN Account" are both a "Service Account."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Content
Some of my Services include the ability to upload, distribute, or modify content. 
You warrant that you own or have permission to use content you upload using the 
Services. You may, at your discretion, make use of generative artificial 
intelligence to produce content for inclusion in my Services. You acknowledge 
that I have no obligation to include such content. You further acknowledge that 
such content is in the public domain, and as such, you have no control of 
ownership over the work. You retain all rights of submitted content, except 
where otherwise provided. To the extent necessary to provide the Services, you 
grant me a worldwide, royalty-free, intellectual property license to use your 
content, for example, to make available to others the contents of your website. 
You may not submit content using the Services under other terms.

Without proper authorization, it is prohibited to use my work or content in any 
circumstance. For some Services, such as website hosting or design, I may provide 
boilerplate code or templates for your convenience. You may edit or adapt these 
freely, but you may not redistribute them. Some content I provide to you may be
covered under a separate license than covered here; if that is the case, you 
must follow the terms of the attached license.

Content I provide to you remains my original work and under my ownership until
such point as the project has been completed. For example, if I design a logo
for you, it remains my work until I transmit all source files. Project completion
refers only to the initial creation stage, and does not include continued hosting
or maintenance of the content. Project completion occurs when all files are sent
with an appropriate notice or a Final Declaration form is signed, along with a
written notice of copyright transfer.

To maintain availability and a quality of service, you acknowledge that I have 
the right, but not the obligation, to remove content in contradiction of this 
Agreement. I further represent to you that I will respond to all legitimate 
requests for content removal under 17 USC Section 512(c)(3).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Limitation of liability
I will defend you against any third party claim brought against you, to the 
extent that such claim is based on an allegation that a paid Service, 
when used as authorized under this Agreement, infringes a United States or 
European Union patent or registered copyright, and I will indemnify you against 
any damages and costs (including reasonable legal fees) awarded by a court of 
competent jurisdiction attributable to such a claim or agreed to settlement by 
myself. If any portion of a paid Service becomes or I believe is likely 
to become the subject of an infringement claim, I may: a) work to procure the 
right for your continued use of the paid Service; b) modify the paid 
Service so it is non-infringing; or c) terminate the paid Service and 
refund your pre-paid costs that would have otherwise covered the remainder of 
your use, and upon termination you agree to immediately cease use of that paid 
Service. I have no obligation under this paragraph with respect to an infringement 
claim that is based upon: a) any use of a paid Service in violation of 
this Agreement; b) any use of a paid Service in combination with another 
product or service not provided by me; or c) any modification of a paid 
Service by any person other than myself or my authorized agents. This paragraph 
outlines my sole and exclusive obligations and your sole and exclusive remedies 
for any claims of infringement of intellectual property rights.

I make no guarantees for the Services I provide. You agree to indemnify and 
hold harmless myself and any third parties I may contract with to provide the 
Services to you from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including 
attorneys' fees), made against me by any third party due to or arising out of 
or in connection with your use of the Services.

I have absolutely no liability in any event for any direct, indirect, inconsequential, 
exemplary, incidental or punitive damages, including lost profits, even if I 
have been advised of the possibility of such damages. To the maximum extent 
permitted by law, these limitations and exclusions apply to anything or any 
claims related to this Agreement, the Services, or the software related to 
the Services.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Licensing
You are granted a commercial, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, 
non-transferable, royalty-free, terminable license to use and access my Services.
Re-selling or re-distributing my Services is not granted under this license.

You acknowledge that my Services and the designs embodied therein are protected 
by copyright, other intellectual property rights and industrial property rights 
and by international treaties. They are and remain at all times the intellectual 
property of myself.

You may not grant others access to my Services, except as otherwise provided. 
Deriving gain, except as permitted by law, from my Services or its contents 
without prior written consent is prohibited. Hotlinking to my Services or otherwise 
accessing Service resources without prior permission is strictly prohibited.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Availability
I attempt to keep my Services available 24/7, but interruptions may occur due 
to outages, maintenance or other circumstances. Factors in availability also 
include your connection to the Internet which may not be stable. A faultless 
operation is impossible, and I do not accept responsibility for any errors that 
may occur. There is no guarantee of uptime or availability of any of my Services. 
You may not represent to users that any facet of your use which is dependent on
my Services has any guarantee of availability. You understand that I reserve the 
right to modify, restrict, or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time.

As a condition of receiving my Services, you acknowledge that I keep no backups 
of your files or data. I attempt to maintain security and robustness of my 
Services, but I make no guarantee as to the completeness or reliability of those 
Services. You are responsible for keeping backups of important data, and you 
acknowledge that I may be unable to recover your data should my Services 
experience any disruption.

You acknowledge that as these Services are not intended or designed for 
enterprise-grade use, quality of Service may be significantly reduced or 
degraded for usage in excess of this Agreement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Attribution
You grant me the right to implement on some Services, such as website design, 
a form of attribution that may display my contact info or website. You may not 
remove, obscure, or otherwise attempt to hide my attribution. This attribution 
may take several forms, such as an email, short text description, or an image.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Prohibited conduct
You may not use my Services in a manner or upload content that I determine:
 - is illegal in the United States or your territory;
 - violates or infringes on the rights, including intellectual and commercial, 
   or privacy of myself or others;
 - instigates or distributes hate or discriminatory speech;
 - contains viruses, malware, trojan horses, or other harmful software;
 - interferes or attempts to interfere with the functioning of my Services;
 - promotes or distributes pornography, obscene content, or other sexual materials;
 - promotes or engages with unsolicited bulk messages or spam;
 - promotes, threatens, incites or engages with terrorism or violence;
 - promotes or engages with web3, cryptocurrency, blockchain, non-fungible tokens, 
   or other decentralized technologies;
 - promotes or engages with drugs, tobacco, or alcohol, especially in connection 
   with use by minors; or,
 - uses my name, image, or likeness to state or imply endorsement or connection 
   of my brand for a particular product, service, or organization.

It is prohibited to use any Service in contradiction with this Agreement. It 
is further prohibited to provide content I share or your users share with you 
to generative artificial intelligence models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude. 
You may not make available any content included (either provided by me or 
submitted by users) within my Services to any dataset or large language model. 
You shall not train an artificial intelligence or large language model on content 
I provide or content that your users provide to you. It is prohibited to make 
use of crawlers, spiders, robots, or other web scraping technologies to make my 
content or any content found in my Services available to or for inclusion in any 
artificial intelligence model. It is prohibited to share personal contact information, 
for myself or your users, to any third party except where required by law.

It is prohibited to grant others access to modify core files of any of my Services,
share content I have provided to you with others, share login credentials to my
Services, or otherwise permit usage of any aspect of my Services that would
put undue stress on my resources or infrastructure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Severability
If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any part of this Agreement to be 
invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall be construed 
as if the invalid part never existed.

Sections 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10 shall withstand termination of this Agreement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Payments
Payments for commercial services may be made using one of the following services: 
Apple Pay, Zelle, PayPal, cash, check, or ACH/bank transfer with no fee, or credit/
debit card with an additional fee. You agree that payments are non-refundable 
except as required by law. Your payment information will be kept private and 
never shared or sold with any third party.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Confidentiality
To facilitate your use of my Services, I may require confidential information from 
you, provide confidential information to you, or share confidential information 
with you from a third-party. You agree to implement all reasonable measures to 
keep confidential all information that is labeled as such or is included in the 
list below. I agree to the same. "Keeping confidential" means not sharing any 
confidential information with anyone, including family members, except where 
authorized in certain circumstances. This Agreement may be shared only among
members or stakeholders of a Limited Liability Company or Corporation.

Confidential information includes:
 - Passwords or account logins
 - Financial information
 - Personal information
 - API keys
 - Payment terms
 - Signed contracts
 - Business or trade secrets

As a condition of using my Services, you acknowledge that I may periodically 
review and monitor your usage of my Services, and may inspect any content used 
in the Services, for example, to verify that your website does not contain any 
prohibited materials. You acknowledge that such content may contain 
confidential information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Third-party sources
From time to time, I may incorporate software or content from third parties. 
Your use of my Services may necessarily be subject to those respective Terms. 
As necessary to provide my Services, non-confidential information may be shared 
with those third parties. Any software or content I incorporate from third parties, 
such as domain name registration or DNS management, is included collectively 
in my Services.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Termination
At any time, you may terminate this Agreement. Should you choose to do so, you 
must notify me as soon as possible and you must immediately cease use of all my 
Services. I, in my sole discretion, and for any reason, including abuse or 
suspected abuse of this Agreement, may terminate your access to my Services. 
You acknowledge that I am not liable for any damages or losses that may result 
from this termination.

If a Service is not accessed within a period of 24 months, your access may be 
revoked and any of your data associated with it may be deleted without notice. 
It is your responsibility to maintain backups of your data. You may request 
deletion of your Source Account or any Service Account at any time.

At any time, and for any reason, I may remove content that I believe to be 
in violation of this agreement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Disclaimer
MY SERVICES AND ITS CONTENTS ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS", "AS-AVAILABLE", AND "WITH 
ALL FAULTS" WITH ABSOLUTELY NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. THERE 
IS NO GUARANTEE OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PUPOSE ARISING 
FROM YOUR USE OF MY SERVICES.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to restrict my right to claim 
damages for any misuse of my Services, now or at any time in the future.

Service-specific agreements

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Website design and hosting

You are permitted to allow others to access your website. You may not permit or 
grant access to others to modify core website files. To a limited extent, you 
may allow users to upload custom content. You may apply your own terms to this 
content, but it is also covered by the license listed in Section 2 Paragraph 1. 
I can not and will not be held liable in any event, including copyright infringement, 
for any content found on your site. You agree that I may place a lightweight, 
privacy-preserving package on each page to monitor usage and gather certain 
analytics, which I may make available to you. You are not permitted to remove 
this package.

If you implement advertisements in your site, you agree to split ad revenue 
85/15 with me (you keep 85%, I get 15%).

You should let users know that their data is transferred to the United States. 
You should include a notice in your privacy policy that some basic analytics 
are being collected. I do not provide a privacy policy or terms of use; however, 
I can advise on certain clauses as they apply to technologies used in my Services.

Effective: 2025-05-27

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Domain name registration

Usage of domain names is subject to policies and regulations promulgated by the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"). If I register a
domain name on your behalf, I become the sole owner and controller of such domain.
You may request that the domain be transferred to your name, or to another registrar
of your choice, but not before 90 days have passed since the first registration
or most recent transfer. Note that a domain name transfer could mean that you
lose access to some or all of your Services.

If you elect to have a domain name transferred to your name, you agree that all
liability rests upon you. You shall be responsible for paying for such domain name,
keeping up-to-date all ICANN required information, and, should you wish to continue
receiving access to certain Services, modifying or updating Domain Name System
records, which process varies by registrar. I am not responsible for any errors
that occur as a result of a registrant transfer.

Effective: 2025-06-02

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Email services

You are allotted a certain amount of email storage, which you are not permitted
to exceed. Additional storage can be purchased for a set price each month, as
determined by myself. In your allotted storage, you may create any number of
mailboxes or folders, and receive as much email as you wish. It is permitted
to share passwords with others in your organization. Should you choose to share
access to a mailbox, you must provide me a list of all authorized users. Such
login details must never be shared or posted publicly.

Note: email is inherently insecure. Reasonable measures have been taken to protect 
the contents of your email while in transit, but email should not be relied upon
for business critical communications, and especially not to transmit confidential
information. If additional security is necessary, consider encrypting your email
before it is sent, such as with S/MIME or PGP.
