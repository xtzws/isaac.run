Isaac's Commercial Services Agreement

==============================================================================
1. Application
This document is an agreement between:
  Isaac Greene d/b/a Isaacal Media and my affiliates ("I", "me", "my", etc.); and
  You. &ldquo;You&rdquo; (or &ldquo;your&rdquo;, &ldquo;yours&rdquo;, etc.) refers
    to the organization entering into this document. For the organization of doubt,
    the entity is responible for compliance with this Agreement by its employees,
    officers, and agents.

The Isaac's Commercial Services Agreement (the "Agreement") applies to your use
of any commercial services (the or my "Services") provided to you by me. You
acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services is governed by the terms of
this Agreement. You warrant that you are a) acting as an authorized agent on
behalf of an organization; b) entering into this Agreement of your own free will;
and c) truthfully representing your intended usage of my Services. This Agreement
may change at any time with 30 days notice.

To use and access my Services, you must accept this Agreement as it is presented
to you without modifications. Your continued use of my Services indicates your
acceptance of the most recent version of this Agreement. If you do not agree to
this Agreement, you must immediately cease use of my Services.

Service-specific terms are attached at the end of this Agreement. Where necessary,
this Agreement may be modified to match your needs. Should this occur, an Addendum
will be created and sent to you for the specific Services you use.

For each Service you use, a new account is created in your name for use in that
particular Service. Your accounts are referred to collectively as the "Source
Account", and any specific accounts are generically referred to as a "Service
Account" for the Service you are using, or in reference to the Service provided.
For example, "Website Account" and "VPN Account" are both a "Service Account."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Content
Some of my Services include the ability to upload, distribute, or modify content.
You warrant that you own or have permission to use content you upload using the
Services. You retain all rights of submitted content, except where otherwise
provided. To the extent necessary to provide the Services, you grant me a
worldwide, royalty-free, intellectual property license to use your content, for
example, to make available to others the contents of your website. You may not
submit content using the Services under other terms.

Without proper authorization, it is prohibited to use my work or content in any
circumstance. For some Services, such as website hosting or design, I may provide
boilerplate code or templates for your convenience. You may edit or adapt these
freely, but you may not redistribute them. Some content I provide to you may be
covered under a separate license than covered here; if that is the case, you
must follow the terms of the attached license.

Content I provide to you remains my original work and under my ownership until
such point as the project has been completed. For example, if I design a logo
for you, it remains my work until I transmit all source files. Project completion
refers only to the initial creation stage, and does not include continued hosting
or maintenance of the content. Project completion occurs when all files are sent
with an appropriate notice or a Final Declaration form is signed, along with a
written notice of copyright transfer.

To maintain availability and a quality of service, you acknowledge that I have
the right, but not the obligation, to remove content in contradiction of this
Agreement. I further represent to you that I will respond to all legitimate
requests for content removal under 17 USC Section 512(c)(3).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Limitation of liability
I will defend you against any third party claim brought against you, to the
extent that such claim is based on an allegation that a paid Service,
when used as authorized under this Agreement, infringes a United States or
European Union patent or registered copyright, and I will indemnify you against
any damages and costs (including reasonable legal fees) awarded by a court of
competent jurisdiction attributable to such a claim or agreed to settlement by
myself. If any portion of a paid Service becomes or I believe is likely
to become the subject of an infringement claim, I may: a) work to procure the
right for your continued use of the paid Service; b) modify the paid
Service so it is non-infringing; or c) terminate the paid Service and
refund your pre-paid costs that would have otherwise covered the remainder of
your use, and upon termination you agree to immediately cease use of that paid
Service. I have no obligation under this paragraph with respect to an infringement
claim that is based upon: a) any use of a paid Service in violation of
this Agreement; b) any use of a paid Service in combination with another
product or service not provided by me; or c) any modification of a paid
Service by any person other than myself or my authorized agents. This paragraph
outlines my sole and exclusive obligations and your sole and exclusive remedies
for any claims of infringement of intellectual property rights.

I make no guarantees for the Services I provide. You agree to indemnify and
hold harmless myself and any third parties I may contract with to provide the
Services to you from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including
attorneys' fees), made against me by any third party due to or arising out of
or in connection with your use of the Services.

My maximum liability in any event for any direct, indirect, inconsequential,
exemplary, incidental or punitive damages, including lost profits, even if I
have been advised of the possibility of such damages, is a refund of the monies you
paid me in the previous six months from the date of your claim. To the maximum
extent permitted by law, these limitations and exclusions apply to anything or
any claims related to this Agreement, the Services, or the software related to
the Services.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Licensing
You are granted a commercial, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-
free, terminable license to use and access my Services.

You acknowledge that my Services and the designs embodied therein are protected
by copyright, other intellectual property rights and industrial property rights
and by international treaties. They are and remain at all times the intellectual
property of myself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Availability
I attempt to keep my Services available 24/7, but interruptions may occur due
to outages, maintenance or other circumstances. Factors in availability also
include your connection to the Internet which may not be stable. A faultless
operation is impossible, and I do not accept responsibility for any errors that
may occur. There is no guarantee of uptime or availability of any of my Services.
You may not represent to users that any facet of your use which is dependent on
my Services has any guarantee of availability. You understand that I reserve the
right to modify, restrict, or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time.

I attempt to maintain security and robustness of my Services, but I make no
guarantee as to the completeness or reliability of those Services. You are
responsible for keeping backups of important data, and you acknowledge that I
may be unable to recover your data should my Services experience any disruption.

You acknowledge that as these Services are not intended or designed for
enterprise-grade use, quality of Service may be significantly reduced or
degraded for usage in excess of this Agreement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Attribution
You grant me the right to implement on some Services, such as website design,
a form of attribution that may display my contact info or website. You may not
remove, obscure, or otherwise attempt to hide my attribution. This attribution
may take several forms, such as an email, short text description, or an image.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Prohibited conduct
You may not use my Services in a manner or upload content that I determine:
 - is illegal in the United States or your territory;
 - violates or infringes on the rights, including intellectual and commercial,
   or privacy of myself or others;
 - instigates or distributes hate or discriminatory speech;
 - contains viruses, malware, trojan horses, or other harmful software;
 - interferes or attempts to interfere with the functioning of my Services;
 - promotes or distributes pornography, obscene content, or other sexual materials;
 - promotes or engages with unsolicited bulk messages or spam;
 - promotes, threatens, incites or engages with terrorism or violence;
 - promotes or engages with drugs, tobacco, or alcohol, especially in connection
   with use by minors; or,
 - uses my name, image, or likeness to state or imply endorsement or connection
   of my brand for a particular product, service, or organization.

It is prohibited to grant others access to modify core files of any of my Services,
share content I have provided to you with others, share login credentials to my
Services, or otherwise permit usage of any aspect of my Services that would
put undue stress on my resources or infrastructure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Severability
If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any part of this Agreement to be
invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall be automatically
modified to the minimum extent possible as to be valid. My failure to enforce any
part of this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of that part.

Sections 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10 shall withstand termination of this Agreement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Payments
Payments for commercial services may be made using one of the following services:
Apple Pay, Zelle, PayPal, cash, check, or ACH/bank transfer with no fee, or credit/
debit card with an additional fee. You agree that payments are non-refundable
except as required by law. Your payment information will be kept private and
never shared or sold with any third party.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Confidentiality
To facilitate your use of my Services, I may require confidential information from
you, provide confidential information to you, or share confidential information
with you from a third-party. You and I agree to implement all reasonable measures
to keep confidential all information that is labeled as such or is included in the
list below. "Keeping confidential" means not sharing any confidential information
with anyone, including family members, except where authorized in certain
circumstances. This Agreement may be shared only among members or stakeholders
of a Limited Liability Company or Partnership or Corporation.

Confidential information includes:
 - Passwords or account logins
 - Financial information
 - Personal information
 - API keys
 - Payment terms
 - Signed contracts
 - Business or trade secrets

As a condition of using my Services, you acknowledge that I may periodically
review and monitor your usage of my Services, and may inspect any content used
in the Services, for example, to verify that your website does not contain any
prohibited materials. You acknowledge that such content may contain
confidential information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Third-party sources
From time to time to provide my Services, I may incorporate software or content
from third party sources. To facilitate your use of my Services, I may share your
information, such as name and email, with these third parties. Any such software
or content I incorporate is included in my Services. If you wish to provide alternate
information to third parties, you must notify me of your intent to do so and provide
me with such information or details on how to obtain such information. I reserve
the right to disregard alternate information in circumstances where I believe it
is necessary to provide default information or where I believe you may not retain
access to alternate information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Termination
At any time, you may terminate this Agreement by notifying me of your intent to
do so by email. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, you must
immediately cease use of all my Services and you must destroy any copies of
proprietary software I have provided to you. I, in my sole discretion, and for
any reason, including abuse or suspected abuse of this Agreement, may terminate
your access to my Services. You acknowledge that I am not liable for any damages
or losses that may result from this termination.

It is your responsibility to maintain backups of your data. You may request
deletion of your Source Account or any Service Account at any time. At any time,
and for any reason, I may remove content that I believe to be in violation
of this agreement.

ALL FAULTS" WITH ABSOLUTELY NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. THERE
IS NO GUARANTEE OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PUPOSE ARISING

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to restrict my right to claim
damages for any misuse of my Services, now or at any time in the future.

Service-specific agreements

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Website design and hosting

You are permitted to allow others to access your website. You may not permit or
grant access to others to modify core website files. To a limited extent, you
may allow users to upload custom content. You may apply your own terms to this
content, but it is also covered by the license listed in Section 2 Paragraph 1.
I can not and will not be held liable in any event, including copyright infringement,
for any content found on your site. You agree that I may place a lightweight,
privacy-preserving package on each page to monitor usage and gather certain
analytics, which I may make available to you. You are not permitted to remove
this package.

Should you choose to implement advertisements in your website, you agree to provide
me with, or agree that I may withhold, 15 percent of the total advertisement revenue.
This paragraph applies to advertisements served through an ad network such as
Google AdSense, and does not apply to sponsorships, promoted content, or branded
materials.

You should let users know that their data is transferred to the United States.
You should include a notice in your privacy policy that some basic analytics
are being collected. I do not provide a privacy policy or terms of use; however,
I can advise on certain clauses as they apply to technologies used in my Services.

Effective: 2025-07-25

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Domain name registration

Usage of domain names is subject to policies and regulations promulgated by the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"). If I register a
domain name on your behalf, I become the sole owner and controller of such domain.
You may request that the domain be transferred to your name, or to another registrar
of your choice, but not before 90 days have passed since the first registration
or most recent transfer. Note that a domain name transfer could mean that you
lose access to some or all of your Services.

If you elect to have a domain name transferred to your name, you agree that all
liability rests upon you. You shall be responsible for paying for such domain name,
keeping up-to-date all ICANN required information, and, should you wish to continue
receiving access to certain Services, modifying or updating Domain Name System
records, which process varies by registrar. I am not responsible for any errors
that occur as a result of a registrant transfer.

Effective: 2025-06-02

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Email services

You are allotted a certain amount of email storage, which you are not permitted
to exceed. Additional storage can be purchased for a set price each month, as
determined by myself. In your allotted storage, you may create any number of
mailboxes or folders, and receive as much email as you wish. It is permitted
to share passwords with others in your organization. Should you choose to share
access to a mailbox, you must provide me a list of all authorized users. Such
login details must never be shared or posted publicly.

Note: email is inherently insecure. Reasonable measures have been taken to protect
the contents of your email while in transit, but email should not be relied upon
for business critical communications, and especially not to transmit confidential
information. If additional security is necessary, consider encrypting your email
before it is sent, such as with S/MIME or PGP.

Effective: 2025-06-02
