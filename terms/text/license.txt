Esoteric Common License
Version 1.0 - 2025-09-15

Prepreamble
As you may have noticed, I'm a fan of writing overly verbose legal documents.
Read the ICSA as an example, or just check out how many of them I've written.
This one is also significantly longer than it needs to be, simply because that's
how I want it.

Preamble
For all the copyright nerds out there, this is technically a «DEDICATION» or a
«WAIVER» but I think «LICENSE» sounds and looks better, especially in the URL,
and license is a little bit clearer at first glance for what this talking about.

I was inspired by Kate Morley after blatantly stealing her CSS for styling forms
which she makes available under the CC0. I did some introspection and realized
that I expected all software to be free as in freedom and free as in beer, and it
would be unfair if I didn't make my work available also. Hence why I'm rambling
to you now.

You may be wondering, if you know of such things, why I don't just mark it with
Creative Commons Zero and be done with it. The reason is that I wanted my work
to actually be in the public domain, at least in my country, and not very nearly
public domain. For many years, I've made my work available to the no one who wants
to use it. My first license was a restricted source available, future apps were
under a more permissive license like the GNU GPL, WTFPL, and the SQLite Blessing.
Creative works have long been licensed with various Creative Commons licenses, like
CC BY-NC-ND for some English work, up to CC-BY for my iNaturalist contributions.
I am entering my next phase of: who tf cares. My thinking for reserving some
rights is that I might be able to make some money off of it in the future. But
that is not going to happen. So I might as well make it available to the most
people. Now onto the dedication.

Amble
To any artistic or literary work or document or software or other piece of
writing (collectively, "work") to which this license or a representation or a
reference or a notice of this license has been applied, then this work is dedicated
to the public domain in the United States.

If you are in one of the other countries and:

  you are in an area that recognizes a foreigner's right to dedicate their work to
  the public domain in the manner in which I have just done so for United States readers:
    then this work is dedicated to the public domain

  or you are in an area that does not recognize the public domain or does not allow
  a foreigner to place their work in the public domain in the manner in which I have
  done so above for United States readers or does not recognize a work that has been
  placed into the public domain by a foreigner in their home country if that work
  would otherwise be protected by your home country's copyright laws:
    then this work is marked Creative Commons Zero

If, in the rare circumstance that none of the above conditions apply to you,
then you have no permission to use my work in any capacity and I will sue you
for every penny you're worth.

Postamble
This could have been made much shorter by simply writing «This work is dedicated
to the public domain the United States and marked CC0 elsewhere.» but they say
brevity is the soul of wit, and this document is not supposed to be funny. Good day.
