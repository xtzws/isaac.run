 <h1>Isaac&rsquo;s Commercial Services Agreement</h1>
 <h2>1. Application</h2>
    <p>This document is an agreement between: <br>&emsp;Isaac Greene and my affiliates (&ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;me&rdquo;, &ldquo;my&rdquo;, etc.); and <br>&emsp;[business], and its members, officers, and agents. &ldquo;You&rdquo; (or &ldquo;your&rdquo;, &ldquo;yours&rdquo;, etc.) refers both to the legal or natural person agreeing to this document and the above mentioned organization.</p>
    <p>The Isaac&rsquo;s Commercial Services Agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) applies to your use of any commercial services (the or my &ldquo;Services&rdquo;) provided to you by me. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services is governed by the terms of this Agreement. You warrant that you are a) acting as an individual or as an authorized agent on behalf of an organization; b) entering into this Agreement of your own free will; and c) truthfully representing your intended usage of my Services. This Agreement may change at any time with 30 days notice.</p>
    <p>If you do not agree to this Agreement, you may not use the Services. If you reject this Agreement after previously agreeing to it, you must immediately cease use of the Services.</p>
    <p>Service-specific terms are attached at the end of this Agreement. Where necessary, this Agreement may be modified to match your needs. Should this occur, an Addendum will be created and sent to you for the specific Services you use.</p>
    <p>For each Service you use, a new account is created in your name for use in that particular Service. Your accounts are referred to collectively as the &ldquo;Source Account&rdquo;, and any specific accounts are generically referred to as a &ldquo;Service Account&rdquo; for the Service you are using, or in reference to the Service provided. For example, &ldquo;Website Account&rdquo; and &ldquo;VPN Account&rdquo; are both a &ldquo;Service Account.&rdquo;</p>

 <h2>2. Content</h2>
    <p>Some of my Services include the ability to upload, distribute, or modify content. You warrant that you own or have permission to use content you upload using the Services. You retain all rights of submitted content, except where otherwise provided. To the extent necessary to provide the Services, you grant me a worldwide, royalty-free, intellectual property license to use your content, for example, to make available to others the contents of your website. You may not submit content using the Services under other terms.</p>
    <p>Without proper authorization, it is prohibited to use my work or content in any circumstance. For some Services, such as website hosting or design, I may provide boilerplate code or templates for your convenience. You may edit or adapt these freely, but you may not redistribute them. Some content I provide to you may be covered under a separate license than covered here; if that is the case, you must follow the terms of the attached license.</p>
    <p>Content I provide to you remains my original work and under my ownership until such point as the project has been completed. For example, if I design a logo for you, it remains my work until I transmit all source files. Project completion refers only to the initial creation stage, and does not include continued hosting or maintenance of the content. Project completion occurs when all files are sent with an appropriate notice or a Final Declaration form is signed, along with a written notice of copyright transfer.</p>
    <p>To maintain availability and a quality of service, you acknowledge that I have the right, but not the obligation, to remove content in contradiction of this Agreement. I further represent to you that I will respond to all legitimate requests for content removal under 17 USC &sect; 512(c)(3).</p>

 <h2>3. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>I will defend you against any third party claim brought against you, to the extent that such claim is based on an allegation that a paid Service, when used as authorized under this Agreement, infringes a United States or European Union patent or registered copyright, and I will indemnify you against any damages and costs (including reasonable legal fees) awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction attributable to such a claim or agreed to settlement by myself. If any portion of a paid Service becomes or I believe is likely to become the subject of an infringement claim, I may: a) work to procure the right for your continued use of the paid Service; b) modify the paid Service so it is non-infringing; or c) terminate the paid Service and refund your pre-paid costs that would have otherwise covered the remainder of your use, and upon termination you agree to immediately cease use of that paid Service. I have no obligation under this paragraph with respect to an infringement claim that is based upon: a) any use of a paid Service in violation of this Agreement; b) any use of a paid Service in combination with another product or service not provided by me; or c) any modification of a paid Service by any person other than myself or my authorized agents. This paragraph outlines my sole and exclusive obligations and your sole and exclusive remedies for any claims of infringement of intellectual property rights.</p>
    <p>I make no guarantees for the Services I provide. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless myself and any third parties I may contract with to provide the Services to you from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees), made against me by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use of the Services.</p>
    <p>I have absolutely no liability in any event for any direct, indirect, inconsequential, exemplary, incidental or punitive damages, including lost profits, even if I have been advised of the possibility of such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by law, these limitations and exclusions apply to anything or any claims related to this Agreement, the Services, or the software related to the Services.</p>

 <h2>4. Licensing</h2>
    <p>You are granted a commercial, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty- free, terminable license to use and access my Services.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge that my Services and the designs embodied therein are protected by copyright, other intellectual property rights and industrial property rights and by international treaties. They are and remain at all times the intellectual property of myself.</p>
    
 <h2>5. Availability</h2>
    <p>I attempt to keep my Services available 24/7, but interruptions may occur due to outages, maintenance or other circumstances. Factors in availability also include your connection to the Internet which may not be stable. A faultless operation is impossible, and I do not accept responsibility for any errors that may occur. There is no guarantee of uptime or availability of any of my Services. You may not represent to users that any facet of your use which is dependent on my Services has any guarantee of availability. You understand that I reserve the right to modify, restrict, or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time.</p>
    <p>I attempt to maintain security and robustness of my Services, but I make no guarantee as to the completeness or reliability of those Services. You are responsible for keeping backups of important data, and you acknowledge that I may be unable to recover your data should my Services experience any disruption.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge that as these Services are not intended or designed for enterprise-grade use, quality of Service may be significantly reduced or degraded for usage in excess of this Agreement.</p>

 <h2>6. Attribution</h2>
    <p>You grant me the right to implement on some Services, such as website design, a form of attribution that may display my contact info or website. You may not remove, obscure, or otherwise attempt to hide my attribution. This attribution may take several forms, such as an email, short text description, or an image.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>It is prohibited to grant others access to modify core files of any of my Services, share content I have provided to you with others, share login credentials to my Services, or otherwise permit usage of any aspect of my Services that would put undue stress on my resources or infrastructure.</p>

 <h2>8. Severability</h2>
    <p>If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any part of this Agreement to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall be construed as if the invalid part never existed.</p>
    <p>Sections 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10 shall withstand termination of this Agreement.</p>

 <h2>9. Payments</h2>
     <p>Payments for commercial services may be made using one of the following services: Apple Pay, Zelle, PayPal, cash, check, or ACH/bank transfer with no fee, or credit/ debit card with an additional fee. You agree that payments are non-refundable except as required by law. Your payment information will be kept private and never shared or sold with any third party.</p>

 <h2>10. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>To facilitate your use of my Services, I may require confidential information from you, provide confidential information to you, or share confidential information with you from a third-party. You and I agree to implement all reasonable measures to keep confidential all information that is labeled as such or is included in the list below. &ldquo;Keeping confidential&rdquo; means not sharing any confidential information with anyone, including family members, except where authorized in certain circumstances. This Agreement may be shared only among members or stakeholders of a Limited Liability Company or Partnership or Corporation.</p>

You acknowledge that such content may contain confidential information.</p>

 <h2>11. Third-party sources</h2>
    <p>From time to time, I may incorporate software or content from third parties. Your use of my Services may necessarily be subject to those respective Terms. As necessary to provide my Services, non-confidential information may be shared with those third parties. Any software or content I incorporate from third parties, such as domain name registration or DNS management, is included collectively in my Services.</p>

 <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p>At any time, you may terminate this Agreement. Should you choose to do so, you must notify me as soon as possible and you must immediately cease use of all my Services. I, in my sole discretion, and for any reason, including abuse or suspected abuse of this Agreement, may terminate your access to my Services. You acknowledge that I am not liable for any damages or losses that may result from this termination. It is your responsibility to maintain backups of your data.

 <h2>Service-specific agreements</h2>
 <h3>Website design and hosting</h3>
    <p>You are permitted to allow others to access your website. You may not permit or grant access to others to modify core website files. To a limited extent, you may allow users to upload custom content. You may apply your own terms to this content, but it is also covered by the license listed in Section 2 Paragraph 1. I can not and will not be held liable in any event, including copyright infringement, for any content found on your site. You agree that I may place a lightweight, privacy-preserving package on each page to monitor usage and gather certain analytics, which I may make available to you. You are not permitted to remove this package.</p>
    <p>Should you choose to implement advertisements in your website, you agree to provide me with, or agree that I may withhold, 15 percent of the total advertisement revenue. This paragraph applies to advertisements served through an ad network such as Google AdSense, and does not apply to sponsorships, promoted content, or branded materials.</p>
    <p>You should let users know that their data is transferred to the United States. You should include a notice in your privacy policy that some basic analytics are being collected. I do not provide a privacy policy or terms of use; however, I can advise on certain clauses as they apply to technologies used in my Services.</p>
    <p>Effective: 2025-07-25</p>

 <h3>Domain name registration</h3>
    <p>Usage of domain names is subject to policies and regulations promulgated by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (&ldquo;ICANN&rdquo;). If I register a domain name on your behalf, I become the sole owner and controller of such domain. You may request that the domain be transferred to your name, or to another registrar of your choice, but not before 90 days have passed since the first registration or most recent transfer. Note that a domain name transfer could mean that you lose access to some or all of your Services.</p>
    <p>If you elect to have a domain name transferred to your name, you agree that all liability rests upon you. You shall be responsible for paying for such domain name, keeping up-to-date all ICANN required information, and, should you wish to continue receiving access to certain Services, modifying or updating Domain Name System records, which process varies by registrar. I am not responsible for any errors that occur as a result of a registrant transfer.</p>
    <p>Effective: 2025-06-02</p>

 <h3>Email services</h3>
    <p>You are allotted a certain amount of email storage, which you are not permitted to exceed. Additional storage can be purchased for a set price each month, as determined by myself. In your allotted storage, you may create any number of mailboxes or folders, and receive as much email as you wish. It is permitted to share passwords with others in your organization. Should you choose to share access to a mailbox, you must provide me a list of all authorized users. Such login details must never be shared or posted publicly.</p>
    <p>Note: email is inherently insecure. Reasonable measures have been taken to protect the contents of your email while in transit, but email should not be relied upon for business critical communications, and especially not to transmit confidential information. If additional security is necessary, consider encrypting your email before it is sent, such as with S/MIME or PGP.</p>
    <p>Effective: 2025-06-02</p>

 <h3>Block storage</h3>
    <p>If you require additional storage beyond what is included with your Service, you may purchase additional blocks of storage. Blocks of 100GB can be purchased for $2.00/month. After 1TB, blocks of 100GB can be purchased for $1.50/month. After 2TB, blocks of 100GB can be purchased for $1.20/month. Storage amounts between 2TB and 8TB carry an additional monthly fee of $7.00. Block storage may not exceed 8TB.</p>
    <p>* 1GB = one billion bytes.</p>
