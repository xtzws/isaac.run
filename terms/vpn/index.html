	<h1>Isaac&rsquo;s Server VPN Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h1>
	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>This is my attempt at a convenient, essentially free VPN. I am also offering it to you for free. Some things you should know before using:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It is not possible to change the country. This is one of the most common reasons to use a VPN, but it is illegal.</li>
		<li>My recommended use is using it for public Wifi, like hotels, airports, or cafes.</li>
		<li>It will encrypt virtually all Internet traffic. It won&rsquo;t encrypt cellular connections, for example calls or SMS/RCS text messages. If you use cell service to connect to the Internet, that traffic is encrypted.</li>
		<li>This (or any VPN) does not &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; make connections more secure. HTTPS websites are still encrypted. HTTP websites still aren&rsquo;t. The main difference is that all the traffic to the Server is encrypted.</li>
		<li>A VPN may be illegal in your country or territory. It is not my responsibility to ensure your compliance with the law.</li>
		<li>The Server will hide your traffic from your ISP.</li>
		<li>The Server does not keep any logs regarding the apps and websites you use.</li>
		<li>You are only able to use 150GB of data in a rolling 30-day period. If you want more, we can work out financial compensation.</li>
		<li>You will almost certainly notice increased latency or decreased speeds. There&rsquo;s nothing I can do about this. Consider temporarily disconnecting from the Server if you need faster speeds or if you&rsquo;re downloading a large file (will also help to keep you under your data limit).</li>
		<li>If you need faster speeds, more options, or better reliability, consider upgrading to a different VPN service. Free options should generally be avoided as they often sell your data and keep detailed logs. In the past, I have used Proton VPN, which has a good free plan and good value for their paid options.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Take a look at Tom Scott&rsquo;s video on what a VPN actually does, or reach out if you have any questions.</p>
	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>The VPN is a self-hosted instance of Outline. This instance of Outline (the &ldquo;Server&rdquo;) does not keep a record of what websites and apps you visit. It does record your usage (measured in data) of the Server using the Access Key I provided to you and reports that back to me. I can not see your IP address, device, or country.</p>
	<p>You can connect to the Server using the official Outline Client (easiest) from Jigsaw, or any Shadowsocks client of your choosing. Your client is subject to different terms than provided here.</p>
	<p>If the Server fails or crashes, limited non-personal information is sent to Jigsaw to help fix stability or performance.</p>
	<p>You agree that all data you send to the Server will be transferred to the United States. The exact data transferred from your device to the Server is dictated by your device and your device settings, but often includes a large majority of Internet traffic (the most common traffic). It does not include cellular or satellite connections, or certain traffic excluded by your operating system for technical reasons. The Server currently respects applications that require their traffic to be sent over non-VPN connections.</p>
	<h2>Terms of Use</h2>
	<p>As part of your usage, you agree to the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You may use the Server on any number of devices controlled by you</li>
		<li>You may not share your Access Key with anyone else, including family or friends</li>
		<li>You will keep your Access Key private</li>
		<li>You may not access the Server from a communal device</li>
		<li>Your usage of the Server may not exceed 150GB of bandwidth in a rolling 30-day period</li>
		<li>You will attempt to keep usage to normal levels and not put undue stress on the Server</li>
        <li>You will attempt to follow the recommendations listed in the above &ldquo;things you should know&rdquo; section</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Usage limits may change at any time without notice.</p>
	<p>You agree that I, in my sole discretion, may restrict or refuse access to the Server for any reason, including abuse or suspected abuse of these terms.</p>
