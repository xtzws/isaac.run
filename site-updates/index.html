        <h2 id="home">isaac.run</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.isaac.run/">isaac.run</a> is my personal homepage. It contains things I want it to contain.</p>
        <h3>2025-07-22</h3>
        <p>The essay was replaced with a passage about procrastination from the Tsurezuregusa, and the design of isaac.run was brought in greater conformance with Isaacal Media corporate guidelines.</p>
        <h3>2025-06-28</h3>
        <p>A political message was published! A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace by John Perry Barlow (1996) was made the homepage. I wrote a corresponding article about it (<a href="gemini://xtzws.com/gemlog/002.gmi">gemini://xtzws.com/gemlog/002.gmi</a>).</p>

        <h2 id="forms">Isaac&rsquo;s Forms</h2>
        <p><a href="https://forms.isaac.run">Forms</a> is my personal form submission site. The way it works is you&rsquo;ll go to the homepage, enter the form code you were given, then take a form. This helps add a little of bit security and helps prevent automated submissions. Fill one out now with code &ldquo;F1&rdquo;!</p>
        <h3>2025-07-25</h3>
        <p>The design was updated to conform to current Isaacal Media corporate guidelines. The backend was partially modularized to better support creating and managing forms. With this update, it should be easier to fill out a form, and it is significantly easier behind the scenes to create a form.</p>

        <h2 id="mail">Mail</h2>
        <p>xtzws.com Mail is the mail server that powers my email and for my clients. Secure, highly-available, bring-your-own-domain email hosting is available starting at $1/month! Please email me at <a href="mailto:webmaster@isaac.run">webmaster@isaac.run</a> if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>
        <h3>Planned</h3>
        <p>Mail will be migrating service providers in the coming months. This reduces wasted resources and enables me to provide better services at scale.</p>

        <h2 id="miskis">Miskis</h2>
        <p>Miskis is the Discord bot I made once. Miskis could do fun things like respond with the national debt if you did <code>/debt</code> and "Pong" if you did <code>/ping</code>!</p>

            <summary>Miskis is shutting down</summary>
            <div>
                <h4>ðŸ“£ Notice</h4>
                <p>Effective immediately, Miskis will be shutting down. Due to increased costs and low usage, it is no longer feasible to operate Miskis at scale.</p>

                <h5>How this affects you</h5>
                <p>It probably won&rsquo;t. Miskis has not receive any commands in several weeks. Additionally, Miskis does not create or maintain any collection of user data, including any information you may have passed to Miskis, any information Miskis has accessed on your behalf, or your Miskis command history. There is no record of Miskis activity, so you can be assured that there is no security risk to the cessation of activity.</p>

                <h5>For applications relying upon Miskis</h5>
                <p>Miskis will cease all operations on all fronts. If you developed or are developing an application built on Miskis, it will stop working unless you find a suitable replacement bot or build your own.</p>

                <h5>Can I keep this going?</h5>
                <p>Yes! If you would like to keep Miskis operational, you can pay for the server costs. To fund it, please pay me $120, which covers the cost of operation for two years.</p>

        <h3>2025-02-24</h3>
        <p>IsaacBot was renamed to Miskis.</p>

        <h2 id="mcbedrock">Everybody do the Wenis!</h2>
        <p>Everybody do the Wenis! was the Bedrock server I ran for a few months.</p>
        <h3>2025-07-06</h3>

            <summary>Everybody do the Wenis! is shutting down</summary>
            <div>
                <h4>ðŸš¨ Urgent Notice</h4>
                <p>Effective Monday, July 14, the Minecraft server, Everybody do the Wenis!, will be shut down. Due to increased costs and low usage, it is no longer feasible to run the server.</p>

                <h5>How this affects you</h5>
                <p>It probably won&rsquo;t. Everybody do the Wenis! has historically received little activity and is unlikely to get more in the future. Because the server does log some information, these data will be deleted immediately after the server is turned off. There is no security or privacy risk due to the cessation of activity. Note that the world itself and the data it contains will not be deleted.</p>

                <h5>Can I keep this going?</h5>
                <p>Yes! If you would like to keep the server operational, you can pay for the server costs. To fund it, please pay me $120, which covers the cost of operation for two years.</p>
