    <div class="card odd">
    The missile knows where it is at all times.
    It knows this because it knows where it isn't.
    By subtracting where it is from where it isn't,
    or where it isn't from where it is, whichever is greater,
    it obtains a difference or deviation.
    </div>

    <div class="card even">
    The guidance subsystem uses deviations
    to generate corrective commands to drive the missile
    from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't,
    and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is.
    </div>

    <div class="card odd">
    Consequently, the position where it is
    is now the position that it wasn't,
    and it follows that the position that it was
    is now the position that it isn't.
    </div>

    <div class="card even">
    In the event that the position that it is in
    is not the position that it wasn't,
    the system has acquired a variation,
    the variation being the difference between where the missile is and where it wasn't.
    </div>

    <div class="card odd">
    If variation is
    considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA.
    However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance
    computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of
    the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is.
    </div>

    <div class="card even">
    However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It
    now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice versa. And by
    differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be and where
    it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called <em>error</em>.
