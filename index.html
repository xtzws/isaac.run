      <p><sup>1 </sup>Listen now, you rich people, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming on you. <sup>2 </sup>Your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten. <sup>3 </sup>Your gold and your silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up your treasure in the last days. <sup>4 </sup>Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Armies. <sup>5 </sup>You have lived in luxury on the earth, and taken your pleasure. You have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter. <sup>6 </sup>You have condemned and you have murdered the righteous one, the one who doesn’t resist you.</p>
      <p>&mdash; James 5 1:6</p>
