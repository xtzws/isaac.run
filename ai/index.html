        I really fucking hate generative AI <sup>[<a href="https://x.com/Procreate/status/1825311104584802470">X</a>]</sup>

      <h2>A resolution to prohibit the use of generative artificial intelligence in any work</h2>
      <p>WHEREAS, AI is defined in this context as those tools commonly labeled generative artificial intelligence, such as those powered by large-language models, generative pre-trained transformers, stable diffusion, or generative adversarial networks. This includes ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Grok, Claude, Character.ai, Llama, etc., and tools or platforms that connect to these tools such as Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and various tailored chatbots; and</p>

      <p>WHEREAS, AI tools have been shown to cause harm and death to its users. <sup>[<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Raine-v-OpenAI-Complaint-8-26-25.pdf">Adam Raine</a>] [<a href="https://apnews.com/article/chatbot-ai-lawsuit-suicide-teen-artificial-intelligence-9d48adc572100822fdbc3c90d1456bd0">Sewell Setzer III</a>]</sup> The modern computer was created with the goal of ending war and violence, leading to millions of lives saved. While computers have always been used in war, such as ENIAC, these use cases have been the primary goal and extremely narrow in their application. It is not the primary goal of modern tech companies to kill its users. At least two cases have come forward that alarmingly present the use of chatbots as being a major contributing factor in two teens committing suicide; and</p>

      <p>WHEREAS, AI and the companies behind those tools have vacuumed up the entire Internet without licensing it or fairly compensating the authors for use in their AI models. Automated scrapers, due largely to the rise of AI chatbots, now account for more than half of all Internet traffic, and up to 80% in some countries. This causes strain on web servers, leads to a loss of revenue for site owners, and unfairly removes attribution to the copyright holders <sup>[<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/is-ai-art-stealing-from-artists">The New Yorker</a>] [<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/09/ai-watchdog-faq/684082/">The Atlantic</a>]</sup>; and</p>

      <p>WHEREAS, Large-language models by their nature do not know fact from fiction. <sup>[<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/what-are-ai-hallucinations-why-chatbots-make-things-up-and-what-you-need-to-know/">CNET</a>]</sup> On some tests, LLMs lie up to 99% of the time. <sup>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04307v3">arXiv</a>]</sup> Because of how trustworthy or authoritative these tools may seem, their output tends to be blindly trusted, despite the fact that it is impossible for them not to produce falsehoods. These mistakes can be costly, in terms of lives lost or lawsuits, when &laquo;experts&raquo; use the tools for things like medicine or law or policy. Already, lawyers have been fined and sanctioned <sup>[<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/careersandeducation/attorney-slapped-with-hefty-fine-for-citing-21-fake-ai-generated-cases/ar-AA1N6qCq">PCMag</a>]</sup> for using generative AI tools that created fake citations; and</p>

      <p>WHEREAS, The datacenters that power the complex calculations behind generative AI are already causing significant harm to the environment, <sup>[<a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ai-has-environmental-problem-heres-what-world-can-do-about">UNEP</a>] [<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117">MIT</a>] [<a href="https://journals.calstate.edu/ai-edu/article/view/5448">Cal State</a>]</sup> the water supply, <sup>[<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-data-center-water.html">NYTimes</a>] [<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cindygordon/2024/02/25/ai-is-accelerating-the-loss-of-our-scarcest-natural-resource-water/">Forbes</a>]</sup> and the energy grid. <sup>[<a href="https://iee.psu.edu/news/blog/why-ai-uses-so-much-energy-and-what-we-can-do-about-it">PennState</a>] [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00478-x">Nature</a>]</sup> We already are dealing with drastic changes in climate that the world is not willing to counteract, as recently reaffirmed at the UN<sup> September 2025</sup> and we do not need yet another climate catastrophe. Residents near these datacenters, and even other tech sites like cryptocurrency miners, report lack of fresh water, dramatic increases in electric bills, constant noise, light pollution, dead crops, air hazards, and more. This is just for those living <em>near</em> the centers. For just electricity, demand is expected to exceed capacity<sup> [<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/09/to-meet-ai-energy-demands-start-with-maximizing-the.html">RAND</a>]</sup> in just five years<sup> 2030</sup>. These changes ripple out and will effect you as well; and</p>

      <p>WHEREAS, I&rsquo;m not going to let a clanker take my job. All of this is not just me complaining about &laquo;the new technology&raquo; and how it&rsquo;s evil. I constantly stay up-to-date on tech trends, try out tools for myself (I have personally used ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Perplexity, and some image generators), but I believe there is significant harm that is dealt when using generative AI. Even if I felt it was perfectly moral to use AI and share all of my personal details with it, I have found that it just isn&rsquo;t that useful. I have never needed to generate an image or get a video created. On the few occasions where I am really out of options and need an LLM, it has, almost invariably, given me the wrong answer. I write and code and create because it is something that I want to do and enjoy doing. It is something I want to be proud of and proclaim, &laquo;I made this!&raquo; and also, most importantly, I want things to <em>be</em> correct instead of just <em>sounding</em> correct <sup>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5wLQ-8eyQI">You are a better writer than AI</a>]</sup>; now, therefore, be it</p>

      <p>RESOLVED, That neither myself nor Isaacal Media will ever make use of generative AI in any capacity to create work. All essays, code, sketches, etc., passed off by me or as Isaacal Media will be proudly 100% human-made.</p>
